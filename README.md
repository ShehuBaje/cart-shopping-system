# JavaScript Beginner Projects

This folder contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript projects I built as part of my foundational learning journey into backend development. Each project is focused on practicing different core concepts of JavaScript, from basic syntax to more advanced features like closures, timers, and functional patterns.

## 📦 Projects Included

- **Weather App Simulation** – Demonstrates the use of timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) and simulates weather updates.
- **Calculator** – Performs basic arithmetic operations with clean UI and logic separation.
- **Contact Manager** – A simple CRUD-based contact system using in-memory arrays.
- **To-Do List** – Task management with add/remove/update functionality.
- **Student Grading System** – Calculates and displays grades based on input scores.
- **Undo/Redo System** – Implements command history using stacks and closures.
- **Search Throttle/Debounce App** – Simulates real-time search input with throttling and debouncing.
- **Pipeline Processor (Middleware)** – Demonstrates control flow using function chaining (like Express middlewares).
- **Property Descriptors Playground** – Explores getters/setters, and descriptor configurations like `writable`, `enumerable`, and `configurable`.

## 🎯 Key JavaScript Concepts Covered

- ✅ Variables and data types
- ✅ Functions & closures
- ✅ Scope & execution context
- ✅ Callbacks and higher-order functions
- ✅ Object manipulation
- ✅ Arrays and looping
- ✅ Timers: `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
- ✅ Property descriptors, getters, setters
- ✅ Functional patterns like `debounce`, `throttle`, and middleware

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of these projects is to build confidence and fluency with the fundamentals of JavaScript — especially the areas most relevant to backend development. Each project is self-contained and intended to reinforce specific theoretical lessons through hands-on application.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)
- Node.js (for CLI-based apps)
- Prompt-sync (for user input in terminal apps)
- Basic HTML & CSS (only for a few UI-based demos)
